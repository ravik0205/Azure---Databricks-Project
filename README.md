# Revolutionizing E-Commerce Data Management with Azure Databricks  
---

## üè¢ Business Objectives  
- Consolidate data from diverse global sources into a unified system.  
- Accelerate the processing and analysis of historical and transactional data.  
- Enable data-driven decision-making through real-time insights.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenges  
1. **Data Quality Issues**  
   - Legacy records with inconsistencies.  
   - Integration challenges from acquired companies.  
2. **Diverse Data Formats and Schemas**  
   - CRM data in CSV format.  
   - Product catalog in JSON format.  
   - Transactional data in Parquet format.  
3. **Complex ETL Processes**  
   - Existing workflows were time-intensive and hard to manage.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution: Modern Data Lakehouse Architecture  
The project leveraged **Azure Databricks** to implement a scalable, reliable, and efficient data lakehouse solution:  

### **Core Components**  
- **Databricks File System (DBFS)**: Ingested data from multiple sources.  
- **Delta Lake**: Provided ACID transactions and reliability for data tables.  
- **Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers**:  
  - **Bronze**: Raw ingested data with minimal transformation.  
  - **Silver**: Cleaned and enriched data with consistent schemas.  
  - **Gold**: Analytics-ready data for reporting and insights.  
- **Databricks SQL**: Enabled high-performance querying.  
- **Power BI**: Used for interactive reporting and dashboards.  

### **Architecture Overview**
